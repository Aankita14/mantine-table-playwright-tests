# mantine-table-playwright-tests

This project is an automated UI testing suite built with **Playwright** to verify functionality in the [Mantine React Table Storybook](https://www.mantine-react-table.dev/?path=/story/prop-playground--default).  
The test cases cover essential table operations such as:

- Column hiding
- Row selection
- Filtering

Each test interacts with the UI and captures screenshots of the result for visual confirmation.


## üì¶ What This Project Does

This automation framework:
- Launches the Storybook UI in Chromium.
- Performs UI actions like hiding a column, filtering data, and selecting rows.
- Takes full-page screenshots as proof of test execution.
